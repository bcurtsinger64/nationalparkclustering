```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Introduction & Data

Data source: https://irma.nps.gov/Stats/

```{r Introduction}
if(!require(pacman)) install.packages('pacman')
p_load(tidyverse)
p_load(tsibble)
data <- read_csv('natpark.csv')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
